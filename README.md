# ASK Zoomba 

ASK Zoomba is a battery-packed powered robot that picks up letters from the floor and turn them into confetti!

## Team

Sandy Chu, Kailin Li, Alvin Tan. 

## Summary

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

Alvin, Sandy, and Kailin's Zoomba (ASK Zoomba) is a close competitor to KiwiBot and the Roomba. Our product involves packaging mail using a

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

The unexpected portion of our project happened to involve the sensors. The light and distance sensor worked momentarily before completely not respeonding at all. We thought it could be issues with the sensor itself, so we tried replacing it with new ones. However, nothing changed and we assume that the connection on the arduino featherboards could be faulty.
